        'This ancient drama became the perfect metaphor for a modern computing puzzle. How can a network of independent nodes agree on a single truth when some may lie, fail, or act selfishly? That is the Byzantine Generals Problem, and every decentralized blockchain must solve it.',
        'In this analogy, generals are nodes and their collective decision to attack or retreat represents the state of the network. A Byzantine failure happens when the system cannot tell honest participants from malicious ones, confusing valid and fraudulent transactions. To stay secure, a majority must reach consensus — and that is where consensus mechanisms come in.',
