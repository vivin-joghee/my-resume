        'Money laundering typically follows three stages:',
        '<ul><li><strong>Placement</strong> where illicit funds enter the financial system</li><li><strong>Layering</strong> where transactions are layered to obscure the trail</li><li><strong>Integration</strong> where funds re-enter the legitimate economy</li></ul>',
        'In <em>RINSED</em>, money laundering is portrayed as:',
        '<ul><li>The common language spoken by all criminal enterprises</li><li>The quiet enabler that connects street-level crime to global finance</li><li>The reason criminals care less about stealing money and more about moving it</li></ul>',
        'When this process combines with complex crypto infrastructure and human trust, scams scale fast. Crypto crime is not niche. It is systemic, well organized, and evolving faster than most defenses.',
        'According to the latest Chainalysis report, more than $3.4 billion in crypto was stolen in 2025, with single incidents accounting for billions on their own. Tens of thousands of individual victims were affected, showing that both institutions and everyday users are targets.',
